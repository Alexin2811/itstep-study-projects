### 🧠 What I learned

During this practical assignment, I have learned to:

- navigate the **AWS Management Console** and locate services;  
- create and manage **IAM users, groups, and policies**;  
- apply the **principle of least privilege** when assigning permissions;  
- use **IAM policies** such as `IAMReadOnlyAccess` and `AdministratorAccess`;  
- verify access rights by logging in under restricted users;  
- configure **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for the root account to improve security.
