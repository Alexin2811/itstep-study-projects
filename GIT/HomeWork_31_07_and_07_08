## 🧩 Assignment Structure

### 🧱 Task 1 — Git Installation and Configuration
- Install Git for your OS:  
  - **Windows:** [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)  
  - **Linux/macOS:** use package manager or [git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/)
- Verify installation with `git --version`
- Configure username and email:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
  git config --global --list
Create a test folder MyGitTest, navigate into it, and initialize Git:

git init


Verify the hidden .git folder exists.

📂 Task 2 — Repository Initialization and File Operations

Create folder Texts and initialize Git repo (git init).

Add initial files:

roosevelt.txt → A selfish victory is always destined to be an ultimate defeat.

franklin.txt → No gains without pains.

Stage and commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Add roosevelt.txt franklin.txt with initial content"
Add new files:

tolkien.txt, shakespeare.txt, thomas.txt

Commit: "Add tolkien.txt, shakespeare.txt, and thomas.txt with quotes"

Edit franklin.txt, add:

bash
Copy code
Well done is better than well said.
and commit the update.

🌐 Task 3 — GitHub & GitHub Desktop
Create a GitHub account and confirm email.

Create a new repository via the GitHub web interface and upload a file.

Locally:

bash
Copy code
git init
echo "Well done is better than well said." > franklin.txt
git add franklin.txt
git commit -m "Add franklin.txt with quote"
Modify, commit, and view log:

bash
Copy code
git add franklin.txt
git commit -m "Add second quote to franklin.txt"
git log --oneline
Restore a previous version with git restore --source=<hash> franklin.txt

Practice multiple commits with inspiration.txt

Use GitHub Desktop to publish the local repo.

Create a new repo directly in GitHub Desktop, add readme.txt, publish, and verify.

Add doyle.txt with two quotes and push to GitHub.
